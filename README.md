<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project leverages deep learning for doing MRI-Image Synthesis and generating segmented images help doctors in studying MRI brain scans.</p>
</div>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<div>

<h2>What it does</h2>
One of the main aspects of our project is MRI Image Synthesis. In this, we convert T1-Weighted images into T2-Weighted images. Along with this, our other model helps by generating Segmented Brain MRI images to show the distribution of white matter.

<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>
So we have created two models, one for Image synthesis and the other does Segmentation. Both works on generating images. We have implemented **VAEs** to achieve the purpose.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>
Learning and understanding the terminologies involved with MRIs really took a while like Preprocessing MRI images requires quite a different methodologies than in general. We were learning PyTorch along with the implementation, and although it's quite pythonic in nature still took some time to wrap our minds around.

<h2>What's next for MRI-Images-Synthesis</h2>
<p>
We will be implementing Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (cGANs) to improve the accuracy of our model. Along with that, we will be creating a web application so that it could be of some help to society.
